    <p class="selfhosted">Any font in the format of OTF or TTF can be hosted online, then the client browser would use that resource to render the font on the screen, however there are tweo key issues:<br>
            <br>- Legal distribution rights of the font
            <br>- Browser incompatiblity
        </p></h3>
        

    
    <h2><p>Webfonts</p></h2>
